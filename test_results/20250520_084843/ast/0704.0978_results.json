Among these, three absorption systems are caused by a galaxy lying on the line-of-sight of a quasar and acting as a gravitational lens. Two systems, one in front of PKS1830[MATH: -]211 (at [MATH: z=0.89]), the other in front of B0218+357 (at [MATH: z=0.68]) are detected at millimeter wavelengths in the lines of several molecules, including HCO[MATH: ^+], HCN and H[MATH: _2]CO.

We derive a flux ratio [MATH: f_A/f_B = 4.2 _{-1.0} ^{+1.8}] for the two main components, A and B, at 106 GHz, which is slightly higher than those derived between 15 and 22 GHz and almost twice larger than observed at frequencies around 2 GHz. This measurement, strictly speaking, applies only to Nov 8 & 9, 2005, the dates of our extended configuration observations."
